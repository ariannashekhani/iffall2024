        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <p>Is my life</p>
        <p>All wasted nights</p>
        <p>This isn't what I had in mind</p>
        <p>To get along</p>
        <p>Do I need someone?</p>
        <p>I think about it all the time</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've gone it alone</p>
        <p>Guess I didn't know</p>
        <p>That curious could amount to this</p>
        <p>When you came along</p>
        <p>I knew what was wrong</p>
        <p>If you want to know exactly what I've missed</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's you</p>
        <p>I'm just saying it's you</p>
        <p>You</p>
        <p>You're what I've been chasing</p>
        <p>Show me where my days went</p>
        <br>
        <p>Did I say a lot</p>
        <p>Take that pressure off</p>
        <p>But kknow that I'm waiting over here</p>
        <p>Ready when you are</p>
        <p>We can take it far</p>
        <br>
        <p>I see it now</p>
        <p>It's funny how</p>
        <p>I'm not afraid of time with you</p>
        <p>When I reflect </p>
        <p>I used to deflect</p>
        <p>In fear of what more years would do</p>
        <p>That changed because of</p>
        <br>
        <p>You</p>
        <p>I'm just saying it's you</p>
        <p>You</p>
        <p>You're what I've been chasing</p>
        <p>Show me where my days went</p>
        <p>It's you</p>
        <p>I'm just saying it's you</p>
        <p>You</p>
        <p>You're what I've been chasing</p>
        <p>Show me where my days went</p>
        <br>
        <p>If I used to see</p>
        <p>You right next to me</p>
        <p>I'd never lack any confidence</p>
        <p>That everything is fine</p>
        <p>In time</p>
        <p>You're what I've been chasing</p>
        <p>Show me where my days went</p>
