        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Arianna Shekhani and I am a junior studying Communication Design with minors in Human-Computer Interaction and Art History.</li>
            <li>I am taking this class because it is required for my major.</li>
            <li>I have very minimal expxerience in HTML and CSS. I worked on one project last year that was a little bit of an intro into these two languages, but I am unfamiliar with JS.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn how to comfortably code in HTML and CSS. I learned how to code in Java a bit last semester, and some of the concepts didn't come to me as quickly because they felt less intuitive. I hope this semester, I am able to get a good grasp on the concepts.</li>
            <li>I expect designing on screen to be different in regards to typography. I think we will have to consider the size of the screen when choosing what size to make our type. Also, we will have to consider line length to determine what is readable.</li>
            <li>The Broma Bakery website (https://bromabakery.com/) is an examaple of an effectively designed website. I think it is intuitive to navigate and there are consistent design choices that are made. Some of these design choices include cohesive font choices and photos. It also looks like a grid was used to design the website, making all the pages intuitive to navigate as the user knows what to expect.</li>
            <li>The WashU Canvas website (https://wustl.instructure.com/) is an example of a website that exemplifies effective communication. I think this is because the sidebar navigation that opens to different pages on the website is easy to navigate and organizes the various pages of the website in an intuitive manner. </li>
            <li>The New York Times website (https://www.nytimes.com/) works well because it organizes a lot of information in a structured manner due to the use of a consistent grid. Additionally, the navigation at the top leads to more pages based on certain topics like Cooking and Business, making the website easy to navigate. Additionally, the search bar at the top left provides users who are looking for something specific to easily find it.</li>
