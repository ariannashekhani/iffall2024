    <h2>Project Title: La La Land Website</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>PROJECT OVERVIEW: The goal of my site is to provide a look into the ideas, persistence, and effort that went into the making of this movie. I want the audience to be able to appreciate the aesthetics of the film while also gaining an understanding of just how much determination was put into realizing the film. </li>

        <li>RESOURCES: Copy is available at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_Land"> La La Land Wikipedia Site</a> as well as some images of the cast and others involved in the film. Additional photos are available on Google Images.</li>

        <li>AUDIENCE: This website will primarily be seen by my peers and instructors. However, I think those who have an interest in film would be interested in this site.</li>

        <li>MESSAGE: I would like to emphasize how this film, with its roots in jazz, something that was considered an "extinct genre," was able to create such a profound impact in cinematic history. I also would like the audience to take away an appreciation for the people behind making the film as well as the beautiful cinematography of the film.</li>

        <li>TONE: I think a grand, vivid tone would both complement the cinematography as well as the background behind the making of the film.</li>

        <li>VISUAL STYLE: I think a decorative, grand visual style could be effective for this site as it informs the aesthetics of the film. The use of color in the film as a symbol of what the characters were going through is something that is so integral to the plot, so I think a play on this could also be an interesting direction to take the visual style in. Alternatively, two colors I immediately associate with the film are purple and yellow, so duotoned images could also work. Also, neon sign-like elements could be a call back to Sebastian's jazz club. Textures like brick could also call back to the club. Also, while the film is set in present day, it takes reference from Los Angeles in the 1940s and 50s, so this is another aesthetic I could lean towards.</li>
