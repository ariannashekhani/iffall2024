                Gorosort
            </h2>
            <p class="info">
                A sorting algorithm introduced in the 2011 Google Code Jam. As long as the list is not in order, a subset of all elements is randomly permuted. If this subset is optimally chosen each time this is performed, the expected value of the total number of times this operation needs to be done is equal to the number of misplaced elements.

                Bogobogosort
            </h2>
            <p class="info">
                An algorithm that recursively calls itself with smaller and smaller copies of the beginning of the list to see if they are sorted. The base case is a single element, which is always sorted. For other cases, it compares the last element to the maximum element from the previous elements in the list. If the last element is greater or equal, it checks if the order of the copy matches the previous version, and if so returns. Otherwise, it reshuffles the current copy of the list and restarts its recursive check.

                Bozosort
            </h2>
            <p class="info">
                Another sorting algorithm based on random numbers. If the list is not in order, it picks two items at random and swaps them, then checks to see if the list is sorted. The running time analysis of a bozosort is more difficult, but some estimates are found in H. Gruber's analysis of "perversely awful" randomized sorting algorithms. O(n!) is found to be the expected average case.

            <p class="info">
                A different humorous sorting algorithm that employs a misguided divide-and-conquer strategy to achieve massive complexity.

                Quantum Bogosort
            </h2>
            <p class="info">
                A hypothetical sorting algorithm based on bogosort, created as an in-joke among computer scientists. The algorithm generates a random permutation of its input using a quantum source of entropy, checks if the list is sorted, and, if it is not, destroys the universe.

                Bozobogo Sort
            </h2>
            <p class="info">
                A sorting algorithm that only works if the list is already in order, otherwise, the conditions of miracle sort are applied.

                Divine Sort
            </h2>
            <p class="info">
                A sorting algorithm that takes a list and decides that because there is such a low probability that the list randomly occurred in its current permutation (a probability of 1/n!, where n is the number of elements), there must have been a reason for the list's order. Therefore, it should be considered sorted in a way we don't understand, and we do not have any right to sort it to our beliefs, as if it were sorted "as God intended." Also known as Intelligent Design sort.
