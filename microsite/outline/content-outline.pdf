    <h2>Project Title: La La Land Website</h2>
    <p>I think I would like to build this site with multiple pages, one for each section of the content to allow for easier viewing of all the content on the site. I would like to have a navigation system at the top of the site that would link to each page within the site.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>HOME PAGE/INTRO INFO: I would like to give a brief introduction into when the movie was made, who directed it, and who starred in it. I would also like to include a brief summary of the plot here.</li>

        <li>PLOT: A more in-depth synopsis of the plot would be detailed here</li>

        <li>CAST: Photos of the main cast members as well as brief descriptions of the characters they play</li>

        <li>PRODUCTION: Idea conceptualization for the film; challenges faced when trying to produce the film; getting the green light to produce the film; aesthetic and conceptual preferences during filming (single take musical numbers, importance of setting); editing process. </li>

        <li>SOUNDTRACK: List of songs with links to where to listen to them </li>

        <li>RECEPTION: Box office; critical response; legacy; culturall impact; accolades</li>

        <li>SOURCES: cite Wikipedia page, reference pages for imagery, etc. </li>

    </ul>
